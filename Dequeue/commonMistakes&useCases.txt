ðŸ§ª Common Mistakes & Best Practices (in Deque)
Mistake / Caution	               |   Fix / Best Practice
Using add() instead of offer()	   |    Use offer() to safely insert without throwing exceptions
Assuming it's thread-safe	       |    Use ConcurrentLinkedDeque for multi-threaded environments
Adding null elements	           |    Avoid null; Deques in Java do not support null
Misusing as a stack with offer     |   	Use push() and pop() for proper LIFO (stack) behavior

ðŸš€ When to Use Deque (Real-World Use Cases)
Use Case	                      |    Why Deque Is Useful
Sliding Window Maximum / Minimum  |    Efficiently discard old or smaller elements from both ends
Monotonic Queue problems	      |   Maintain increasing/decreasing order using double-ended ops
Palindrome checking               | 	Easily compare characters from both front and back
Zigzag level order traversal	  |  Alternate level direction by pushing/popping from both ends
BFS with flexible level control	  |  Use front/back insertions for level-wise or priority handling
